## Roadmap

- Handle components data/actions with UI
- Handle props for data
- Handle component template with a UI with boxes and data (el, attrs, childrens - like render)

## BUGS

- Instance state is not updated if template changes to another meta-component
    > Example: Put a light in stage and change it to a counter, state is not changed
